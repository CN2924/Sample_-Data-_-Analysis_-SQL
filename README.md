# PROJECT-PORTFOLIO--Superstore-Sales-SQL-Data-Analysis 

In this Superstore Sales SQL Data Analysis project, an exploratory data analysis was performed on the Superstore Sales Data available on Kaggle. The main aim of the project is to uncover insights into the store's sales and profits trends and patterns from 2014 to 2017. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, the profits trends were visualized by states, region, category, sub-category and timeline (years or quarters). Additionally, top-performing, least-performing products and the most profitable customers were identified. After, the data is displayed in a Tableau interactive dashboard. 2 versions of the dashboard exist. A yearly focus and a quarterly focus. The analysis below provided valuable insights into the Superstore's sales and profits performance and identified areas for improvement. The project demonstrated the usefulness of SQL in data analysis and decision-making.

If there is mainly an interest in the yearly (timeline) data on profits, categories, sub categories, segments and products, then below you will find the direct link to the dashboard: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/micheltableau/views/SalesDataAnalysis-YearlyFocus2/SalesDataAnalysis-YearlyFocusDashboard?:origin=card_share_link&:embed=n

If it is instead the quarterly (timeline) data that interests you, then the results are in this dashboard instead: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/micheltableau/views/SalesDataAnalysis-QuarterlyFocus/SalesDataAnalysis-QuartelyFocusDashboard?:origin=card_share_link&:embed=n
